# Mauna Loa CO₂ Data Processing Notes

## Data Source
This dataset is provided by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) as part of the Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. The data were collected at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) through Flask, Insitu, and Surface PFP sampling at hourly, daily, monthly, and discrete frequencies, providing CO₂ concentrations over multiple decades.

*I have only included the Flask Monthly dataset as it is useful for determining the seasonal trend for Mauna Loa, i.e., it contains contiguous and equidistant data.*
