Lab-wide notes:

2011-10-07

We introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA or Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR)
University of Colorado Boulder that made the measurement.  We can 
now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace gas species 
in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are

6. INTRODUCTION

CO2 dry air mole fractions reported in these files were measured by a
nondispersive infrared absorption analyzer or cavity ring-down spectrometer
(since Aug., 2019) in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA GML Carbon
Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network sites. Measurements are reported
on the X2019 CO2 mole fraction scale. Calibration procedures are given in Komhyr
et al., 1983; Komhyr et al., 1985; Thoning et al., 1987, and Thoning et al.,
1995; and Tans et al.,2017. Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by Komhyr et al., 1985; Conway et al., 1988; Tans et al., 1989a; Tans
et al., 1990, and Conway et al., 1994.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ambient and standard air samples is detected using a
non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer. The measurement of CO2 in air is made
relative to standards whose CO2 mole fraction is determined with high precision
and accuracy. Because detector response is non-linear in the range of
atmospheric levels, ambient samples are bracketed during analysis by a set of
standards used to calibrate detector response. Measurements are reported in
units of micromol/mol (10^-6 mol CO2 per mol of dry air or parts per million
(ppm)).

In August, 2019, we switched from a NDIR to a Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer that
analyzes CH4 and CO2. The analyzer is calibrated off-line with a suite of
standards once per month relative to a dry, natural air, reference in a
high-pressure cylinder.  All air samples are measured relative the same
reference, and CH4 and CO2 values in measured samples are calculated based on
their ratio to the reference.  Repeatability of the analyzer, based on repeated
analysis of air from a high-pressure cylinder, is ~0.02 ppm (1 sigma).

Measurements are directly traceable to the WMO X2019 CO2 in air mole fraction
scale.


Air samples are collected in programmable flask packages (PFP) using
programmable compressor packages (PCP). The PCP contains battery-powered pumps
for flushing and pressuring the flasks. The PFP contains twelve 0.7L cylindrical
borosilicate glass flasks with glass valves on each end sealed with Teflon
O-rings, a stainless-steel manifold on each side of the flasks, and a data
logging and control system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.3 DATA - FILE TYPES

We now provide some NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory measurements
in two unique file formats; netCDF and ASCII text. 

The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a self-describing, machine-independent
data format that supports creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
scientific data.  To learn more about netCDF and how to read netCDF
files, please visit http://www.unidata.ucar.edu. 

The ASCII text (technically UTF-8 encoded) file is derived directly from the 
netCDF file.  The text file is also self-describing and can be viewed using 
any ASCII or UTF-8 capable text editor.  "Self-describing" means the file 
includes enough information about the included data (called metadata) 
that no additional file is required to understand the structure of the data 
and how to read and use the data.  Note that some non-ASCII characters (accents,
international character sets) may be present in various names and contact 
information.  These may require a UTF-8 capable text editor to view properly.

7.4 DATA - CONTENT

See individual files for description of the provided variables and other 
dataset metadata.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA GML uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.6 COLLECTION METHODS

A single-character code is used to identify the sample collection method.
The codes are:
    A - The automated or manual filling of a whole air sample using the
Programmable Flask Package (PFP) and Programmable Compressor Package (PCP)air
sampling devices. The air sample is contained in a 0.7 liter borosilicate
glass container (flask) fitted with two Glass Expansion high vacuum glass
piston valves sealed with PTFE O-rings. The flasks are typically flushed with
10 liters (aircraft samples) or 75 liters (tower samples) of ambient air and
then pressurized to 40 psia. Air is delivered through an intake tube using
two diaphragm pumps connected in series and controlled with a microprocessor.
The flow rate is approximately 15 L/min at sea level.  See Sweeney et al.
2015 and Andrews et al. 2014 for more details.
    C - Air samples are collected as with method 'A', but the sample air is
dried before sample collection. Flasks are not pre-filled with ambient air
before flushing and collecting  the air sample.
    I - Air is sampled from a 15L spherical stainless steel mixing volume
after being filled with ambient air that was pulled through an M&C Techgroup
Model ECP 20-2 gas chiller using an integrating compressor and mass flow
controller. The two stainless steel dryer traps are plumbed in series, held
at approximately 5 degrees C and the condensed water is removed with a
peristaltic pump. Prior to sample collection, an additional glass
conditioning step known as "prefilling" occurs where the glass containers are
flushed and filled with ambient air and then vented and flushed immediately
before air sample collection. This is a glass conditioning step that
addresses glass wall effects of the gases of interest.  After 'prefilling',
the integration starts with a high flow rate of 3.8 SLM and decreases over
time to 0.29 SLM over 1 hour. The resulting one hour time averaged ambient
air sample is compressed into a 0.75 liter borosilicate glass container
(flask) fitted with 2 Glass Expansion high vacuum glass valves and PTFE
O-rings. The flask is typically filled to 40 psia. (See Turnbull, J.C.,
Guenther, D., Karion, A., Sweeney, C., Anderson, E., Andrews, A.E., Kofler,
J., Miles, N.L., Newberger, T., Richardson, S.J., Tans, P.P., 2012. An
integrated flask sample collection system for greenhouse gas measurements.
Atmos. Meas. Tech. 5, 2321-2327.)
    B - Air samples are collected as with method 'R', but with an additional
drying step  using one of several techniques. In one method, e.g. site=ACT,
air samples were dried with a two-stage chiller cooled to 5 degrees C; those
taken below 3000 m MSL were also pressurized to 40 psia to further facilitate
air sample drying (Baier et al. 2019). At tower sampling sites, M&C chillers
with temperatures set to approximately 3 degrees C and sub-ambient pressure
due to high flow are used (Andrew et al. 2014). At CRV tower, a two-stage
chiller set to -26 degrees C is used. 
    R - Air samples are collected as with method 'A', but with an additional
glass conditioning step known as "prefilling". During prefilling,  the glass
containers are flushed and filled with ambient air and then vented and
flushed immediately before air sample collection. This is a glass
conditioning step that addresses glass wall effects of the gasses of interest
(Andrews et al. 2014).
    X - Testing method for pfp drying experiments. CP-> chiller pressurized
