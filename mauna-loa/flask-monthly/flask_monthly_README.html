Lab-wide notes:

2011-10-07

We introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA or Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR)
University of Colorado Boulder that made the measurement.  We can 
now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace gas species 
in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species group (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

Project-specific notes:

2022-07-21

Dataset is now provided in self describing ObsPack format with improved metadata.
Surface flask event data are available in NetCDF and ASCII text. Surface flask
monthly data are available in ASCII text. Shipboard data binned by 5 or 3 degrees
are now removed from surface flask event data, but still provided in monthly data.
This format change makes some previous notes irrelevant.

Parameter-specific notes:

2023-05-01

In Spring 2023, we moved to an internal quality control
(QC) tagging system for the flask air samples.
There are three categories of tags documenting
issues associated with sample collection, measurement
and representativity in the CCGG database.
Tags are more specific than flags, which allows
a more granular internal tracking and analysis of QC issues.

Tags are converted to simplified 3 character flags in the data
files for external data users.  See section 7.5 for more details.

CO2 measurements from flask-air samples were recalculated onto the 
X2019 CO2 mole fraction scale by first reassigning all standards used 
on the CO2 analysis systems to X2019. CO2 values on X2019 from air 
samples were calcuclated by reprocessing the original raw files (i.e., 
files with raw analyzer output (typically voltages)) with the updated 
assignments for the standards. A detailed description of the scale 
revision from X2007 to X2019 is given in Hall et al. (2020), but the 
main reasons were to correct biases caused by CO2 absorption by 
O-rings in the manometric calibration system and to correct a virial 
coefficient used in the calculation. The magnitude of the differences 
between X2019 and X2007 varies with CO2 abundance, and is typically 
between 0.1 and 0.2 ppm. Some differences from the late-2000s and 
early-2010s are larger (up to ~0.3 ppm) because of a mis-assigned 
standard on the system used to transfer the scale to working standards.
Measurements prior to ~1980 from early analytical systems (instrument codes 
LR1 and LR2) could not be reprocessed onto X2019; they remain on a CO2 
scale originally developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

2020-07-15

Based on comparison with in situ measurements at SPO and SYO 
(from National Institute of Polar Research, Japan), a storage 
correction was applied to flask-air samples measured for CO2. 
The correction is ~0.2 ppm/yr at SPO and 0.08 ppm/yr at SYO. 
Uncertainty for the correction has not yet been determined and 
applied to the measurement uncertainty, but it is estimated to 
be ~0.05 ppm.

2018-07-30

1. Uncertainties (68% c.i.) were estimated for all CO2
measurements. Uncertainty entries of -999.99 occur
when a reasonable uncertainty could not be calculated.

2. In 2017, began using N.. to flag samples not meeting
pair agreement criteria. 

2016-07-07

We discovered a small leak in the intake line of the portable
sampler at Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland (ICE) that affected CO2.
All samples from 1 July 2009 through 28 June 2016 were
flagged N.. for CO2.

2012-08-03

Corrections for drifting standard gas cylinders have been
applied to all samples measured on the following instruments
through the specified date.

Instrument ID             Analysis Date

   L3                      thru 2009-10
   L8                      thru 2010-06
   L10                     thru 2010-10


2011-10-13

Discrete (flask) CO2 mole fractions from 1980 to 2006 have all
been recalculated to bring them onto the WMO X2007 Mole Fraction
Scale (X2007). The data since 2007 were already on the X2007 scale.
WMO X2007 is based on repeated manometric measurements of the NOAA
primary standards (Zhao et al. 2006) and comparison of those results
to similar measurements made over a period of more than 10 years at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The difference between the X2007
and the previous scales propagated by SIO and NOAA (X83, X87, etc.)
is ~0.2 ppm (X2007-previous) in the 1980s, decreasing to ~0.1 ppm in
the late 1990s, and to 0.0 ppm by 2006. The recalculation of individual
measurements was accomplished by first determining the X2007 values for
the reference gases used to measure the air samples and then using those
values with the raw data (NDIR voltages) to recompute mole fractions
for each sample.

1999-01-01

Corrections have been applied to CO2 mole fractions measured
on the flask analysis apparatus in use from July 1987 through
April 1998.  The corrections are +0.1 ppm to samples measured
from July 1987 through 18 November 1993, and +0.24 ppm to samples
measured from 19 November 1993 through 10 April 1998.

Corrections for drifting reference gas cylinders have been
applied to all samples measured during 1995 through April 2008
on system L3 and 1998 through May 2007 on systems S2 and L3.

Files obtained previously from this site should be discarded and
replaced with the revised files contained in this version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. INTRODUCTION

CO2 dry air mole fractions reported in these files were
measured by a nondispersive infrared absorption
analyzer or cavity ring-down spectrometer (since Aug., 2019) 
in air samples collected in glass flasks at
NOAA GML Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling 
Network sites. Measurements are reported on the X2019 CO2
mole fraction scale. More information on this scale is available 
here: https://gml.noaa.gov/ccl/co2_scale.html

Calibration procedures are given in
Komhyr et al., 1983; Komhyr et al., 1985; Thoning et al.,
1987, and Thoning et al., 1995; and Tans et al.,2017. 
Analysis and interpretation of the data have been reported 
by Komhyr et al., 1985; Conway et al., 1988; Tans et al., 
1989a; Tans et al., 1990, and Conway et al., 1994.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ambient and standard air samples was
historically detected using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) 
analyzer. The measurement of CO2 in air was made relative to 
standards whose CO2 abundance was determined with high precision 
and accuracy. Because detector response is non-linear in the range
of atmospheric levels, ambient samples are bracketed during 
analysis by a set of standards used to calibrate 
detector response. Measurements are reported in units of 
micromol/mol (10^-6 mol CO2 per mol of dry air or parts per 
million (ppm)). 

In August, 2019, we switched from a NDIR to a Cavity Ring-Down
Spectrometer that analyzes CH4 and CO2. The analyzer response is
calibrated off-line with a suite of standards once per month 
relative to a dry, natural reference air in a high-pressure 
cylinder.  All air samples are measured relative to the same reference,
and CH4 and CO2 values in measured samples are calculated based 
on their ratio to the reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Uncertainties of the CO2 measurements are included.
Key components of it are our ability to propagate the WMO XCO2
scale to working standards, the repeatability of the analyzers
used for sample measurement, and the long-term reproducibility.
Zhao and Tans (2006) determined that the internal consistency of
working standards is +/- 0.02 ppm (68% confidence interval). The 
typical repeatability of the analyzers, based on repeated 
measurements of natural air from a high-pressure cylinder, 
is +/- 0.06 ppm for NDIR and +/- 0.02 ppm for CRDS. Long-term 
reproducibility is estimated to be +/- 0.03 ppm based on 
repeated measurements of air from a high-pressure cylinder, or 
the long-term variability in the differences between measurements 
of test flasks on the flask-air analysis system and separate 
measurements of the test gas used to fill the test flasks.

Pacific Ocean Cruise (POC, travelling between the US west coast
and New Zealand or Australia) flask-air samples were collected in
about 5 degree latitude intervals. For South China Sea (SCS), samples
 were collected at about 3 degree latitude intervals.

Sampling intervals are approximately weekly for fixed sites
and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for POC and
about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.

Historically, samples have been collected using two general methods:
flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump, or opening a
stopcock on an evacuated glass flask; since 28 April 2003, only the
former method is used.  During each sampling event, a pair of flasks
is filled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.3 DATA - FILE TYPE

We now provide some NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory measurements
in two unique file formats; netCDF and ASCII text. 

The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a self-describing, machine-independent
data format that supports creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
scientific data.  To learn more about netCDF and how to read netCDF
files, please visit http://www.unidata.ucar.edu. 

The ASCII text (technically UTF-8 encoded) file is derived directly from the 
netCDF file.  The text file is also self-describing and can be viewed using 
any ASCII or UTF-8 capable text editor.  "Self-describing" means the file 
includes enough information about the included data (called metadata) 
that no additional file is required to understand the structure of the data 
and how to read and use the data.  Note that some non-ASCII characters (accents,
international character sets) may be present in various names and contact 
information.  These may require a UTF-8 capable text editor to view properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - CONTENT


See individual files for description of the provided variables and other
dataset metadata.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

Quality control 3-column flags indicate retained and rejected flask
results as follows in datafiles.

If the first character is not a period, the sample result should be
rejected for scientific use due to sample collection and/or measurement
issue. A second column character other than a period indicates a sample
that is likely valid but does not meet selection for representativeness
such as midday sampling or background air sampling. A third column flag
other than a period indicates abnormal circumstances that are not thought
to affect the data quality.

                Flag    Description

Retained        ...     good pair, no other issues

Rejected        M..     sample measurement issue
                C..     sample collection issue
                B..     both measurement and collection issues

Selection       .S.     selection issue. High/low mole fraction
                        thought to not represent background
                        conditions for example.

Informational   ..M     informational measurement tag or
                        potential measurement issue
                ..C     informational collection tag or
                        potential collection issue

The retained values comprise the data set that mostly represents
CO2 distribution in the remote, well-mixed global surface atmosphere.
Data with selection flag (with a 2nd column flag other than '.') are
likely valid measurements, but represent poorly mixed air parcels
influenced by local sources. Data selection is applied using a curve
fitting approach described in detail here:
https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/mbl/crvfit/crvfit.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.6 COLLECTION METHODS

A single-character code is used to identify the sample collection method.
The codes are:

    P - Sample collected using a portable, battery
 powered pumping unit.  Two flasks are
 connected in series, flushed with air, and then
 pressurized to 1.2 - 1.5 times ambient pressure.
    D - Similar to P but the air passes through a
 condenser cooled to about 5 deg C to partially
  dry the sample.
    G - Similar to D but with a gold-plated condenser.
    T - Evacuated flask filled by opening an O-ring sealed       
 stopcock.
    S - Flasks filled at NOAA GML observatories by sampling
 air from the in situ CO2 measurement air intake system.
    N - Before 1981, flasks filled using a hand-held
 aspirator bulb. After 1981, flasks filled using a
 pump different from those used in method P, D, or G.
    F - Five liter evacuated flasks filled by opening a
 ground glass, greased stopcock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.7 DATA - MONTHLY AVERAGES

The monthly data files in https://gml.noaa.gov/aftp/data/trace_gases/co2/flask/surface/ 
use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     [parameter]_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_month.txt

(ex) CH4_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CH4 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific
     Ocean Cruise sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) CO2_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CO2 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

Monthly means are produced for each site by first averaging all
valid measurement results in the event file with a unique sample
date and time.  Values are then extracted at weekly intervals from 
a smooth curve (Thoning et al., 1989) fitted to the averaged data 
and these weekly values are averaged for each month to give the 
monthly means recorded in the files.  Flagged data are excluded from the
curve fitting process.  Some sites are excluded from the monthly
mean directory because sparse data or a short record does not allow a
reasonable curve fit.  Also, if there are 3 or more consecutive months
without data, monthly means are not calculated for these months.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information 
followed by one line for each available month.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection year and month.
Field 3:    [MONTH]

Field 4:    [MEAN VALUE] Computed monthly mean value

-------------------------------------------------------------------
